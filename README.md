# SelfAndroidTraining

*So I decided to go through the developer site and I Have been refering the API docs for development and can make Android apps. I see it has a Training section and decided to go through it one by one in order to learn Android Development through the docs.*

The idea here is for me that I'll go through the remaining doc completely and as I go along i'll try to use all the elements to make something stupid and try to cover the entire doc and see if it makes me a better developer.

Why I am doing this?
--------------------
Well I recently started learning Kotlin as from what it looks like , it cuts down a lot of code and it seems like if i learn it well enuf ill be able to develop faster . of course one has to write good code in order to do that but my main objective is that I want to learn to code in kotlin as it looks pretty and it is something i want to try. so here it goes.
